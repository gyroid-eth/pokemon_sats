# pokemon_sats
This repository contains a .txt file which contains a list of Pokémon names, each followed by the .sats domain. 

Here's what has been done:

Removing Spaces: Any space present in the Pokémon names has been removed. 

Converting to Lowercase: All the Pokémon names have been converted to lowercase. 

Removing Duplicates: Any duplicate entries (due to mega evolution etc) in the list have been removed.

Feel free to use this list for your own projects!
